# JS_Coding2

I'm still really new to JavaScript so I started working on a book that I had here at home which is geared to beginners. The book is called Get Coding 2.
In this book your create 5 different JS games. The first game that I worked on was a version of tic-tac-toe. In this game it helped me learn the basics of using JS and it actually made sense!
